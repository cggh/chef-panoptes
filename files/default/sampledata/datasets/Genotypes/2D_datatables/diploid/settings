NameSingle: diploid
NamePlural: diploid
Description: A table of diploid genotypes

ColumnDataTable: variants            # The 1D data table where each entry corresponds to a column
ColumnIndexField: SnpName            # The column name in ColumnDataTable that maps into ColumnIndexArray, note that "AutoKey" can be used if your rows do not have Unique IDs
ColumnIndexArray: col_index          # 1D Array in HDF5 that gives the value of ColumnIndexField for each column,
                                     # if this is missing then it is assumed that the HDF5 columns are in the same
                                     # order as the "ColumnDataTable" sorted by "ColumnIndexField"

RowDataTable: samples                # The 1D datatable where each entry corresponds to a row
RowIndexField: ID                    # The column name in RowDataTable that maps into RowIndexArray, note that "AutoKey" can be used if your rows do not have Unique IDs
RowIndexArray: row_index             # 1D Array in HDF5 that gives the value of RowIndexField for each row
                                     # if this is missing then it is assumed that the HDF5 rows are in the same
                                     # order as the "RowDataTable" sorted by "RowIndexField"

FirstArrayDimension: row             # Either 'row' or 'column' to indicate the first dimension in the HDF5 array. Eg. array[1] == 'a row' or array[1] == 'a column' 'column' will generally perform better

Properties:
    -  Id: genotype                            #Name of dataset in HDF5

    Call:  genotype                  # Reference to property that holds the calls
    AlleleDepth: allele_depth        # Reference to property that holds allele depths, if avaliable
    ExtraProperties:                 # Properties that will be available to map to display properties
